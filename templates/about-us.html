            <h3>About us</h3>
            <p>Medical clinics are an essential service that many individuals utilize in their daily lives, yet many patients in HawaiÊ»i 
                struggle to find clear and specific information about healthcare providers in one centralized place. This project aims to 
                create an easy-to-navigate website that centralizes essential information on healthcare services, with a particular focus 
                on sports medicine for those seeking specialized care.
            </p>

            <p> We are addressing the challenge of healthcare accessibility to specialized health services (i.e., medical services focused 
                on specific area or medicine, often provided by specialists) by creating a website, â€˜Rehab Reviveâ€™, that provides information 
                on nearby health clinics, more specifically Physical Therapy Clinics, Medical Imaging Clinics and Orthopedic Clinics. Our goal 
                is to assist the general public find curated, specific, and wanted information on these three types of specialized  health services 
                in OÊ»ahu, HawaiÊ»i.
